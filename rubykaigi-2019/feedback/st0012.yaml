questions:
  fun:
    # 楽しかったですか？
    # Did you have fun?
    # 楽しかった場合はどういう部分が楽しかったかも教えてください。（例：Ruby書くことそのものが楽しかった、●●のgemの作者とお話できたから、など）
    # If you had fun, what kind of part was fun?（ex:Because I was able to talk with the author of ●●gem, Ruby it was fun to write, etc.）

    It's an excellent event to make new friends (and meet some old friends as well). 
    It's also very fun to have someone discussing open source works in person.
  groups:
    # どのグループに参加しましたか？
    # Which groups did you join?
    - Rails
  next:
    # 今後も日常的にOSS開発を続けたいですか?
    # Will you keep on contributing to open source?
    |
    I'm already an regular contributor and still will be in the future 😄
  etc:
    # なにか思ったことがあれば自由に書いてください。
    # Pleae give us any feedback.

    I hope we can have some kind of chat rooms for each team. It'll be easier to share information between members
